# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project I analyze the how both the goal of a Kickstarter campaign, and the launch date of the campaign relate to the outcome of the campaign.
--
### Purpose
I am trying to determine if there are optimal contribution goals and best times to launch Kickstarter campaigns in order to maximize the chances of having a successful campagin.
This analysis could also be used to help explain why a campaign may not have been as successful as anticipated. This specific analysis is focused on kickstarter campaigns for plays in a theater.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
