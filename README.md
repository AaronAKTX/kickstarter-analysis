# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, I analyze how both, the goal of a Kickstarter campaign and the launch date of the campaign, are related to the outcome of the campaign.

### Purpose
I am trying to determine if there are optimal contribution goals and the best times to launch Kickstarter campaigns to maximize the chances of having a successful campaign.
This analysis could also be used to help explain why a campaign may not have been as successful as anticipated. This specific analysis was done with data from Kickstarter campaigns 
for plays in a theater.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analzye the how the Launch date may effect the outcome of a Kickstarter campaign, I used the data of Kickstarter campaigns that occurred between the years 2009 and 2017. In my analysis, I filtered out any
campaigns that were not in the Theater category. I grouped the data by months. I categorized the outcomes of the campaigns into three categories, successful, failed and canceled (I did not
include campagins that were currently live). A quick look at Theater Campaign outcomes based on Launch Date tells us that the most successful campaigns are launched in May, June, and July. (see chart below): ![](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
